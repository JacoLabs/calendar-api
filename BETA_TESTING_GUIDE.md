## üéØ What to Test

### Priority Testing Areas

#### 1. **Date & Time Parsing** (High Priority)
Test if the system correctly understands:
- ‚úÖ "tomorrow at 2pm"
- ‚úÖ "next Friday 3:30pm"
- ‚úÖ "October 25th at 3pm"
- ‚úÖ "in 3 days at noon"
- ‚úÖ "Monday morning 9am"

**What to check**: Is the date and time correct? Does it account for your timezone?

#### 2. **Event Titles** (High Priority)
Test if it extracts good titles:
- ‚úÖ "Lunch with Sarah at The Bistro"
- ‚úÖ "Doctor appointment next week"
- ‚úÖ "Team standup meeting"
- ‚úÖ "Call with client to discuss project"

**What to check**: Is the title clean? Does it remove date/time info from the title?

#### 3. **Location Detection** (Medium Priority)
Test location extraction:
- ‚úÖ "Meeting at Starbucks on Main Street"
- ‚úÖ "Conference in Room 301"
- ‚úÖ "Dinner at 123 Oak Avenue"

**What to check**: Does it correctly identify the location?

#### 4. **Duration & End Times** (Medium Priority)
Test duration understanding:
- ‚úÖ "Meeting for 2 hours"
- ‚úÖ "30 minute standup"
- ‚úÖ "Conference from 9am to 5pm"
- ‚úÖ "All day event"

**What to check**: Does it calculate the end time correctly?

#### 5. **Complex Descriptions** (Low Priority)
Test with detailed descriptions:
- ‚úÖ "Quarterly planning meeting with sales team to discuss Q4 goals and strategy for next year"
- ‚úÖ "Lunch meeting with potential client Sarah Johnson at The Bistro downtown to discuss the new website project"

**What to check**: Does it handle longer text? Does it extract the essential information?

### 5. **API Testing** (For Developers)

**Base URL**: https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com

#### cURL Example:
```bash
curl -X POST https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com/parse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Team meeting tomorrow at 2pm in Conference Room A",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }'
```

#### Python Example:
```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime

def parse_event(text):
    response = requests.post(
        'https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com/parse',
        json={
            'text': text,
            'timezone': 'America/New_York',
            'now': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
    )
    return response.json()

# Test
result = parse_event("Lunch with Sarah next Friday at noon")
print(f"Title: {result['title']}")
print(f"Start: {result['start_datetime']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence_score']}")
```

#### JavaScript Example:
```javascript
async function parseEvent(text) {
  const response = await fetch('https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com/parse', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      text: text,
      timezone: Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
      now: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  });
  return await response.json();
}

// Test
parseEvent("Team standup Monday 9am").then(result => {
  console.log('Title:', result.title);
  console.log('Start:', result.start_datetime);
  console.log('Confidence:', result.confidence_score);
});

## üåü What Makes a Great Bug Report

### ‚úÖ Good Example:
```markdown
**Platform**: Android App
**Device**: Samsung Galaxy S21, Android 13

**Input**: "Lunch with Sarah next Friday at The Bistro downtown"

**Expected**:
- Title: Lunch with Sarah
- Date: 2025-10-25 (next Friday)
- Time: 12:00 PM (assuming noon)
- Location: The Bistro downtown

**Actual**:
- Title: Lunch with Sarah next Friday
- Date: 2025-10-25 12:00:00
- Time: 12:00 PM
- Location: (empty)
- Confidence: 0.72

**Issue**:
1. Location "The Bistro downtown" not detected
2. Title includes "next Friday" which should be removed
3. Confidence is lower than expected for straightforward event

**Screenshots**: [Attached]
```

### ‚ùå Poor Example:
```markdown
"It doesn't work"
```

**Why it's poor**: Not specific, no details, can't reproduce

## üí° Testing Tips

### 1. **Test in Your Context**
Use real event descriptions from your daily life:
- Your actual meeting invites
- Calendar reminders you receive
- Text messages with event info
- Email event descriptions

### 2. **Vary Your Tests**
- Try morning, afternoon, evening events
- Test different days (today, tomorrow, next week, specific dates)
- Use different locations (restaurants, addresses, room names)
- Mix formal and informal language

### 3. **Check Edge Cases**
- What if you don't specify a time?
- What if you only specify a date?
- What about very vague descriptions?
- How does it handle typos?

### 4. **Compare Across Platforms**
Test the same event text on:
- Web interface
- Browser extension
- Mobile apps (if available)

Do they give consistent results?

### 5. **Pay Attention to Confidence Scores**
- **0.9-1.0**: Very confident (should be very accurate)
- **0.7-0.9**: Confident (generally reliable)
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate confidence (check carefully)
- **0.0-0.5**: Low confidence (likely issues)

Report when confidence doesn't match accuracy!

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: How do I know if the API is working?
**A**: Check the health endpoint: https://calendar-api-wrxz.onrender.com/health
If it returns `{"status":"healthy"}`, it's working!

### Q: What timezone should I use?
**A**: The system detects your timezone automatically in most cases. For API testing, you can specify your timezone explicitly:
- `"timezone": "America/New_York"` (EST/EDT)
- `"timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"` (PST/PDT)
- `"timezone": "Europe/London"` (GMT/BST)
- `"timezone": "UTC"` (UTC)

### Q: How long should responses take?
**A**: Typically 1-3 seconds. If it takes longer than 10 seconds, please report it!

### Q: Can I test with non-English text?
**A**: Currently only English is supported, but international date formats should work.

### Q: What if I find a security issue?
**A**: Please email [Your Email] directly instead of posting publicly.

### Q: Can I test the mobile apps without installing?
**A**: Start with the web interface! It uses the same parsing API. For full mobile testing, installation is required.

### Q: Do I need to test everything?
**A**: No! Test what interests you and what fits your workflow. Even testing one scenario helps!

### Q: How often should I test?
**A**: Test whenever convenient! We'll notify you when major updates are released.

### Q: Will my data be stored?
**A**: No! All parsing is stateless. We don't store your event descriptions.

### Q: Can I suggest new features?
**A**: Absolutely! Use the "Feature Request" issue type or mention it in your feedback.
