# Quick Fix for Icon Issues

## Problem
The extension is failing to load because Chrome can't find the icon files.

## Immediate Solution
I've removed all icon references from the manifest.json and background.js to get the extension working immediately.

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Reload the extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find "Calendar Event Creator"
   - Click the reload button (üîÑ)

2. **The extension should now load successfully** without icon errors

3. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Select text like "Meeting tomorrow at 2pm" on any webpage
   - Right-click and select "Create calendar event"
   - Or click the extension icon (it will use Chrome's default icon)

## What was changed:
- Removed `"icons"` section from manifest.json
- Removed `"default_icon"` from action section
- Removed `iconUrl` from all notification calls in background.js

## Adding Icons Back (Optional):
If you want to add icons back later, you can:

1. **Create proper icon files**:
   - 16x16 PNG for toolbar
   - 48x48 PNG for extension management
   - 128x128 PNG for Chrome Web Store

2. **Add back to manifest.json**:
   ```json
   "icons": {
     "16": "icons/icon-16.png",
     "48": "icons/icon-48.png", 
     "128": "icons/icon-128.png"
   },
   "action": {
     "default_popup": "popup.html",
     "default_title": "Calendar Event Creator",
     "default_icon": {
       "16": "icons/icon-16.png"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Test that all icon files load properly**

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Extension should load without errors
‚úÖ Context menu should work
‚úÖ Popup should work
‚úÖ Calendar integration should work
‚ùì Extension will use Chrome's default icon (gray puzzle piece)

The extension is now functional - the missing icon is just cosmetic!
