## API Integration Enhancements

### Enhanced Request Format
```json
{
  "text": "Meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "now": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "use_llm_enhancement": true
}
```

### Enhanced Response Format
```json
{
  "title": "Meeting with John",
  "start_datetime": "2024-01-16T14:00:00-05:00",
  "end_datetime": "2024-01-16T15:00:00-05:00",
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "field_results": {
    "title": {
      "value": "Meeting with John",
      "source": "regex",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "span": [0, 17]
    }
  },
  "parsing_path": "regex_primary",
  "processing_time_ms": 150,
  "cache_hit": false,
  "warnings": [],
  "needs_confirmation": false
}
```

### Query Parameters Support
- `mode=audit`: Enable audit mode with detailed parsing information
- `fields=title,start_datetime`: Request partial parsing for specific fields only

## Error Handling Improvements

### Structured Error Responses
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "PARSING_ERROR",
    "message": "Could not extract date information",
    "suggestion": "Please include specific date and time"
  }
}
```

### Client Error Handling
- Network error detection and retry logic
- Timeout handling with fallback options
- User-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions
- Graceful degradation to local parsing when API unavailable

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Support
- 24-hour TTL caching with normalized text hashing
- Cache hit status reporting in API responses

### Timeout Management
- Browser Extension: 15-second timeout with retry
- Android App: 15-second timeout with exponential backoff
- iOS App: 30-second timeout with retry logic

### Partial Parsing
- Essential fields prioritization (title, start_datetime, end_datetime)
- Fallback to partial parsing when full parsing fails
- Reduced API payload for specific field requests

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
